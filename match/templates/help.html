<p>
  The left hand-side of the screen shows the addreses of a job centre,
  while the right hand-side shows possible matches from
  AddressBase. If you find an address that matches, just click it. If
  none match, click "No match", and if you're not sure, click "Not
  sure".
</p>

<p>
  You only need to match the addresses - the name of the job
  centre is not important. The more matches you make
  and the more correct they are, the more you score.
</p>


<h2 class="heading-small">Background</h2>

<p>
  The goal is to find the definitive address of each job centre.
</p>

<p>
  The address shown on the left hand-side is from a list of job
  centres. The addresses on the right are drawn from AddressBase data
  containing a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN). We want to find
  the UPRN of each job centre, by matching the job centre text address
  on the left to the correct UPRN-associated address on the right.
</p>

<p>
  Matching addresses is hard. Automated matching only takes us so far,
  and typically misses the most complex addresses. This tool takes the
  crowd-sourcing approach: participants are asked to match addresses
  manually from a list of possible candidates.
</p>

<p>
  Your score will reflect the number of matches you've made, as well
  as how well your guesses match other people's. Enough matches will
  allow us to establish with a good degree of certainty the correct
  answer.
